MY PROJECT.
Cleaning Services Website

Small brief

A website that offers cleaning services can be a lifesaver. The platform can connect customers with local cleaning companies and individual cleaners, as well as offer reviews and ratings to help users make informed decisions.

In addition to booking services, the website can also sell cleaning supplies and tools for at-home use. Revenue can be generated through a commission fee for each booking, as well as advertising space for cleaning companies on the website.

The website can also offer tips and tricks for maintaining a clean living space, and even feature blogs from professional cleaners sharing their insights and expertise. This can make the website a one-stop destination for all things related to cleaning.
